# üõí Amazon Web Scraping with Python

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates how to scrape product data from **Amazon** using Python. The goal is to extract useful information such as **product titles, prices, ratings, and reviews**, and then organize it into a structured dataset for further analysis.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** Web scraping may violate Amazon‚Äôs Terms of Service. This project is intended for **educational purposes only**. For production-level data, it is recommended to use the official **Amazon Product Advertising API**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Libraries

* **Python 3.x**
* **Requests** ‚Äì to send HTTP requests to Amazon pages.
* **BeautifulSoup (bs4)** ‚Äì to parse HTML and extract product details.
* **Pandas** ‚Äì for data storage and manipulation.
* **NumPy** ‚Äì for numerical operations.
* **Time / Random** ‚Äì to manage request delays and mimic human browsing.
